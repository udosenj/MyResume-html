    <h2>Summary</h2>
         <p>
            Personally, I would say that my strongest skill is improvisation. Learning how to creatively combine the little things around me in order to create something that would serve as a need or a good to another is what I do best. I have a strong passion for technology and software and enjoy leaving happy moments that would last a lifetime wherever I go.
